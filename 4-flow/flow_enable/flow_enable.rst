Overview

In this exercise you will enable Nutanix Flow.

Enabling Flow
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Flow is built into Prism Central and requires no additional appliances or consoles to manage. Before you can begin securing your environment with Flow, the service must be enabled.

.. note::

  Flow can only be enabled once per Prism Central instance. If **Microsegmentation** displays a green check mark next to it, that means Flow has already been enabled for the Prism Central instance being used. Proceed to :ref:`flow_secure_app`.

#. In **Prism Central**, click the **?** drop down menu and select **Microsegmentation**.

   Flow can only be enabled once per Prism Central instance. Flow will require an additional 1GB of memory for each Prism Central VM, but there is no action required by the user as this occurs automatically. Additionally, the enable process verifies that each connected AHV host has at least 1GB of free RAM. The list of Flow capable AHV clusters is listed in the enable window.

   If **Flow** displays a green check mark next to it, that means Flow has already been enabled for the Prism Central instance being used. Proceed to `Securing An Application`_.

#. Select **Enable Microsegmentation** and click **Enable**.

Takeaways
+++++++++

- Microsegmentation, part of Flow, is a decentralized security enforcement framework centrally managed from Prism Central.
- Once Flow is enabled in the cluster, VMs can be easily protected through Security Policies created in the Prism Central UI. Security Policies use simple text based categories to define groups of VMs. These function as labels that can easily be applied to VMs without any additional network setup.
